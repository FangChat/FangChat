Welcome to FangChat's Repository.

This is the official repository of the chat app Fang Chat.

Users can use this repository as a medium other than our mail to discuss issues.However we recommend to mail us if you have a serious issue with using our app as we will reply to mails faster than we do so here.

This repository can be used to discuss about any new features that you wish could be seen in the app and well experienced developers can inform us if there is a my bug in the app but we will only provide the source code for those who provide a proof that it will not be misused and the proof that you are a developer should be sent to our mail with a subject and body requesting for source code of the app.

We might exclude the code that connects to the server or the code that we are sure that it doesn't have bugs and will provide you the part of coding that we feel should be shared with developers.If we find any leak or misuse of the code we will deprecate the acces to our code and to ensure this we will be providing our code through a software and will have control of all your actions.So do not try to do any suspicious activity with the code.

Thank you for using our fang services.
